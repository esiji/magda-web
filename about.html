        <p>Magdalena M. Gabriel is renowned for fostering transformative global partnerships across arts, sustainability, philanthropy, cultural diplomacy, and innovation. With a distinguished career spanning corporate law, international business, and the arts, she serves as a trusted advisor to UHNW family offices, royalty, global leaders, and international organisations.</p>
        <p>Magdalena combines cultural intelligence with strategic vision to facilitate high-impact partnerships that drive sustainable innovation and global influence. Her educational foundation includes a law degree and advanced studies at the London School of Economics (LSE), where she pursued post-graduate courses in “Macro-Economics.” She continued her studies at LSE in collaboration with the University of Beijing, specializing in Management, Entrepreneurship, and Global Leadership. Additionally, her studies at Christie’s Education provide her with a unique interdisciplinary approach to addressing complex global challenges.</p>
        <p>Her career began at CMS Cameron McKenna and Howard Kennedy LLP, specialising in international negotiations and cross-border transactions, before expanding her expertise at Glencore International AG, where she developed deep insights into the energy sector and large-scale enterprise management.</p>
        <p>Magdalena’s work in cultural diplomacy was profoundly shaped by her collaboration with Damien Hirst, one of the most famous contemporary artists of his time. Renowned for his provocative exploration of themes like life, death, and beauty, Hirst made history with his record-breaking £111 million auction, Beautiful Inside My Head Forever, which redefined the global art market. Magdalena played a pivotal role in creating key sculptures showcased in Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable, Hirst’s most ambitious project, nearly a decade in the making.</p>
        <p>Commissioned by global magnate and French billionaire - François Pinault, founder of the Kering Group (parent company of Gucci, Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga), the project was held at Palazzo Grassi and Punta della Dogana in Venice. It redefined the boundaries between art, commerce, and storytelling. Pinault, a global leader in luxury and contemporary art patronage, leveraged his Venetian museums to serve as iconic hubs for cutting-edge artistic expression. Magdalena’s involvement in this groundbreaking project provided her with invaluable insights into the convergence of creativity, commerce, and cultural diplomacy, shaping her distinctive approach to building strategic partnerships.</p>
        <p>Building on this experience, Magdalena directed her efforts toward impactful philanthropic initiatives, connecting global leaders, institutions, and foundations to address critical environmental and social challenges. As a patron of Le Bal de La Riviera, an initiative organised by Prince Charles Philippe D Orleans, Duke of Anjou, to foster global solidarity and friendship, Magdalena played a pivotal role in aligning the HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. This collaboration lead to raising collectively over $40 million for environmental initiatives, with subsequent Monaco events generating an additional €10 million. In 2016, she contributed to securing €800,000 for Moroccan healthcare services under the patronage of HRH Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco.</p>
        <p>Magdalena’s ability to connect diverse elements into cohesive, impactful projects is evident in her curation of high-profile initiatives. These include On Top of the World, hosted by David Linley, Earl of Snowdon and nephew of King Charles III, featuring renowned artists Giacometti and Sonia Falcone. She collaborated with Societe Generale Private Banking, one of Europe’s leading financial institutions, and Princess Ira von Fürstenberg, a royal, socialite, and cultural icon, to bridge the worlds of philanthropy, luxury design, and cultural innovation. Among Magdalena’s notable endeavors is her work with Arturo Di Modica, who was the iconic sculptor behind the Charging Bull, a powerful symbol of financial strength, resilience, and ambition. Prominently located on New York’s Wall Street, the Charging Bull draws millions of visitors annually, captivated by its embodiment of determination and success. Inspired by the concept of a “bull market,” which signifies rising stock prices and investor confidence, the sculpture has become a global emblem of economic optimism. Immortalized in The Wolf of Wall Street, Di Modica’s bold vision and artistry aligned seamlessly with Magdalena’s ability to amplify cultural and economic narratives. Her creative partnerships with Smart Beijing, Bvlgari, Ellen von Unwerth, Tory Burch, Patrick Grant, Joana Vasconcelos, Prince Ea, Rolls Royce, Pierre Bonefille and the Enzo Enea Tree Museum further illustrate her skill in creating synergies that combine art, sustainability, and innovation.</p>
        <p>Magdalena has also partnered with Monaco Art Week under HSH Patronage of Prince Albert of Monaco, where she orchestrated collaborations with Tezos, a leading blockchain platform renowned for its environmentally friendly proof-of stake model alongside Quotidien de l'Art, CADAF (Contemporary and Digital Art Fair) and Binance, bridging traditional art with emerging technologies. Additionally she curated and contributed to impactful art movement as the UNESCO- endorsed ONE OCEAN ONE FUTURE project. This initiative, which addressed critical issues of plastic polution and environmental preservation, underscores her commitment to using art and cultural diplomacy as tool for raising global awareness and fostering environmental actions.</p>
        <p>Currently, Magdalena serves as Global Head of International Business Relations for UHNW Family Office, a legacy enterprise renowned for billion-dollar ventures, including the co-founding of Wimm-Bill Dann, Europe’s largest dairy producer, acquired by PepsiCo for $5.8 billion. The Family Office has been focusing on global projects reflecting its principals’ commitment to environmental responsibility and social impact.</p>
        <p>A key aspect of her role is facilitating high level conversations that advance strategic initatives and pursuing ambitious ventures including Fortune 500 companies, wealth funds and international NGO`s. Her work reflects ability to navigate complex negotiations and align the interest of public and private entities.</p>
        <p>She has also served as an advisor to the Group CEO of Esyasoft, a pioneering technology company specializing in IoT, AI, and analytics solutions for the energy sector. Esyasoft is a subsidiary of Sirius International Holding which operates under umbrella of IHC (International Holding Company) one of the UAE largest and most diversified conglomerates.</p>
        <p>Magdalena is a dedicated advocate for the arts. She is a young patron of the Tate Modern and the Victoria & Albert Museum and has been a member of the Future Contemporaries committee of the Serpentine Galleries, a globally leading contemporary art institution chaired by Michael Bloomberg, since 2014. Additionally, she serves as an advisory board member of Musée Collection des Arts, one of Europe’s largest private art collections.</p>
        <p>Magdalena’s work embodies visionary leadership, global collaboration, and sustainable innovation, positioning her as a dynamic force for transformative change.</p>
